# Microservices Product User Gateway

This repository demonstrates a microservices-based architecture built with Spring Boot. It includes services for managing **Products** and **Users**, with features like service discovery, API gateway integration, and inter-service communication using Feign Client.

## üåü Features

- **ProductService**: Manage products (CRUD operations).
- **UserService**: Manage users (CRUD operations).
- **Service Registration**: Eureka Server for dynamic service discovery.
- **Zuul Gateway**: API gateway for routing and load balancing.
- **Feign Client**: Simplified inter-service communication.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Separate services for easy scaling and management.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building and deploying microservices.
